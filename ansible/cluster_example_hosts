# The following blocks configure which of the roles will be installed on which
# of the machines defined in the [all] section above. The comments above the
# blocks explain if the role is optional or mandatory for a clustered setup.

# Mandatory, three or five servers
[consul_servers]
db1
db2
db3

# Optional; if you already run a Redis server, you can use that.
# When installing Redis as part of the cluster, three servers are required.
[redis_servers]

# Optional. If you run a MySQL or Oracle database you can use that.
# When installing the database as part of the cluster, three or five
# servers are required.
[database_servers]
db1
db2
db3

# When running a clustered database, these servers need one virtual IP
# address they share. Only one of the active servers will be used by
# the application to guarantee no write access on identical rows occurs
# on different servers, as these would lead to deadlocks.
[database_servers:vars]
database_cluster_ip=10.0.1.20

# Optional. You can use an external NFS storage.
[nfs_servers]
db1
db2
db3

# Required when installing without external connection. Optional but heavily
# recommended when access to the outside world is enabled. Multiple hosts can
# be configured to ensure redundancy.
[docker_registry]
db1

# Define where logs generated by all docker containers are sent to.
# Optional but heavily recommended. Multiple targets are supported.
[loghost]

# Required. Choose a number of servers that can handle the load generated by
# your client applications.

tw3

# Required. This role can be installed on the same servers as the backend
# when an existing load balancer is used.

# Optional. This role allows you to expose a single IP address (configured in
# the section below) to the client application while maintaining redundancy.
